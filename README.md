# Python Basics

This repository was a great way to get a feeling for Python just by playing with it. 
I started to make my first steps by learning something about the following topics: 

- Variables
- If Statement
- While loop
- Strings

At the end of each section there are some questions which I answerd and marked it always with **# Question**.

## Additionally 
Addtionally we learned a lot about how jupyter notebooks work, what to do with GitHub and how to navigate trough our Unix Shell. 
At the end of the day we took a look at the Style Guide for Python Code [Pep8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) and the Zen of Python.
