# Python - Basics

Throughout this entire repository you should be 
experimenting with the code in the non-text 
cells. A great way to begin to get a feel 
for Python is by playing with it. 
As pairprogrammers have some fun by changing the values 
in the cells and then running them again 
with Shift-Enter. 

At the end of each section there will be 
some questions to help further your 
understanding. Remember, 
in Python we can always manually test things 
by trying them out; however, 
you should try to think about the answers 
to these questions before you run some code. 
This way you can check and verify your 
understanding of the section's topic.
Please discuss further questions in your group of two.

## The way to success:

Please **work together as Pair-Programmers** through all the notebooks
in this particular order:

1. Numeric variable types
2. If-Statement (if, elif, else)
3. Looping (while)
4. Strings

Keep in mind, you succeed better as a team.

There are NO stupid questions! 

If you already feel comfortable with the concepts,
you might even learn more from teaching them!
